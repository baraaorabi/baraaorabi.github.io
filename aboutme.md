## Tiny bit of history
My name is Baraa Orabi. It's an Arabic name (براء عْرابي), which is pronounced **/baraːʔ ʕraːbi/**. My famaily is [Damascene](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Damascus) but I was born and raised in [Jeddah](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeddah). I liked to think of myself as both Damascene and [Hejazi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hejaz).

I speak [Damascene Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levantine_Arabic} as my mother tongue. I have (very) modest knowledge of Turkish.  I am most comfortable when I can [code-switch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code-switching) between Arabic and English (with some Turkish vocab added for fun).  

After finishing highschool, I went to [Bilkent University](http://w3.bilkent.edu.tr/bilkent/) in Ankara, where I had my B.Sc. in Computer Engineering. Currently, I am a M.Sc. student at [Simon Fraser Univerisity](https://www.sfu.ca/) in Metro Vancouver. where I am supervised by [Dr. Cedric Chauve](http://www.cecm.sfu.ca/~cchauve/) and [Dr. Faraz Hach](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~fhach/personal/). I am also part of Dr. Hach lab at [Vancouver Prostate Centre](http://www.prostatecentre.com/about-us/people/dr-faraz-hach) where I spend most of my time.

## Interests
### Computer science and biology
I am working on computational cancer genomics. This involves using very large computers to manupilcate 4-lettered alphabet (aka DNA). It's a lot of fun, and I get to feel good about what I am doing 😁.

### Philosiphy
I am quite intersted in analytical philosophy. As an undergrad, I took a whole bunch of philosophy courses as part of my (aborted) minor in philosphy. Before that I used to read philosophy with my amazing friends in beautiful bookstore/cafe in Jeddah called Jusoor (shutdown by the Saudi Govt. because we were "too political" 💔).

### Politics
I'm an addict 😐. Please help...
